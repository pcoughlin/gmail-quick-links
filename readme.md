# Gmail Quick Links

A Chrome Extension / Firefox Add-on to replace the existing Gmail Quick Links
currently found in Gmail Experimental Labs that Google is
[retiring](https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2017/03/updates-in-g-suite-to-streamline-hangouts-and-gmail.html).

Supports multiple logged-in gmail accounts, with ability to create quick links
that work across all logged-in accounts or a quick link that is specific to one
account.

Icons come from [Icons8](https://icons8.com/icon/12610/add-link-filled). Please
use them, they're great.

### Background

As of 3/24/2017, Google retired the Gmail Experimental Labs, which included the
original Dan P. Gmail Labs Quick Links extension. This extension was built to
bring back that original Quick Links experience.

### Help, the extension worked before and it no longer works!

Gmail aggresively changes their UI styles without warning. The extension looks
at certain class names to determine where to insert the Quick Links. If none is
found, it cannot insert. If you are noticing that Quick Links no longer appear
in your navigation, please file an issue.
